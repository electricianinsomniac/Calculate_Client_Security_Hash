you can follow step by step to complete the excercise by read [Process Design Document](https://github.com/electricianinsomniac/Calculate_Client_Security_Hash/blob/main/Calculate%20Client%20Security%20Hash%20-%202021.10%20Complete%20Exercise%20Walkthrough%20().pdf) from UiPath 

 The document describes the sequence of steps performed as part of the process, the conditions and rules of the process prior to automation. This design document serves as a base documentation for developers to collect the details required for robotic automation of the same business process.

## Overview
The following process has been selected for RPA as part of the larger project initiative conducted within ACME Systems Inc, the Finance and Accounting department.
