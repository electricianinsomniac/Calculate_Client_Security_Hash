# Calculate_Client_Security_Hash
Robotic Process automation (RPA) in UIPath. The automation will need to process DataRows for each transaction so the data type for TransactionItem will be DataRow. 

## Introduction
Calculating a client security hash is a crucial step in ensuring the security of sensitive information transmitted between a client and a server. In this project, we aim to develop a secure mechanism for calculating and verifying the client security hash. The algorithm will be designed to generate a unique hash value for each client, based on their authentication credentials, and verify the authenticity of the client's information during transmission. The security of the hash calculation process will be maintained through the use of secure encryption algorithms and protocols. The goal of this project is to create a reliable and efficient solution for maintaining the security of sensitive information transmitted over networks.

you can follow step by step to complete the excercise by read [Process Design Document](https://github.com/electricianinsomniac/Calculate_Client_Security_Hash/blob/main/Calculate%20Client%20Security%20Hash%20-%202021.10%20Complete%20Exercise%20Walkthrough%20().pdf) from [UiPath](https://academy.uipath.com/)

 The document describes the sequence of steps performed as part of the process, the conditions and rules of the process prior to automation. This design document serves as a base documentation for developers to collect the details required for robotic automation of the same business process.

## Overview
The following process has been selected for RPA as part of the larger project initiative conducted within ACME Systems Inc, the Finance and Accounting department.
